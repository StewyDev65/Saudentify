Saudentify can create fingerprints from audio files, store them in a database, and identify songs from both microphone input and audio files.

## ✨ Features

- 🎧 Create audio fingerprints from music files and store them in a database
- 🎤 Identify songs from microphone input
- 📁 Identify songs from audio files
- 📂 Batch import music files from directories
- 📝 Extract metadata from MP3 files (artist, title)
- 🔄 Support for WAV and MP3 formats

## 📋 Prerequisites

- [Java 21](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/downloads/#java21) (recommended) or [Java 11](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase/jdk11-archive-downloads.html)
- Dependencies:
    - SQLite JDBC Driver
    - JAudioTagger library
    - mp3spi library from googlecode.soundlibs

## 🛠️ Installation

1. Clone this repository
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/StewyDev65/Saudentify.git
   cd Saudentify
   ```

2. Build with Maven
   ```bash
   mvn clean install
   ```

   Or Gradle
   ```bash
   gradle build
   ```

3. Make sure all dependencies are in your classpath
   ```xml
   <!-- Maven dependencies -->
   <dependencies>
       <dependency>
           <groupId>org.xerial</groupId>
           <artifactId>sqlite-jdbc</artifactId>
           <version>3.36.0</version>
       </dependency>
       <dependency>
           <groupId>org.jaudiotagger</groupId>
           <artifactId>jaudiotagger</artifactId>
           <version>2.0.1</version>
       </dependency>
       <dependency>
           <groupId>com.googlecode.soundlibs</groupId>
           <artifactId>mp3spi</artifactId>
           <version>1.9.5.4</version>
       </dependency>
   </dependencies>
   ```

## 🚀 Usage

Run the application:

```bash
java Saudentify
```

### Main Menu Options

Once running, the application provides the following options through a command-line interface:

| Option | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| 1 | **Add a song to database** - Add an individual song file to the fingerprint database |
| 2 | **Identify song (from microphone)** - Record audio from your microphone and try to identify the playing song |
| 3 | **Identify song (from file)** - Identify a song from an audio file |
| 4 | **List all songs in database** - View all songs currently stored in the fingerprint database |
| 5 | **Add multiple songs from directory** - Batch import multiple audio files from a specified directory |
| 0 | **Exit** - Close the application |

### Adding Songs to Database

When adding songs (option 1 or 5), the system will:
- Extract audio features to create a fingerprint
- For MP3 files, extract metadata (artist and title) when available
- Store the fingerprint in the database for future matching

### Identifying Songs

When identifying songs (option 2 or 3), the system will:
- Create a fingerprint from the input audio
- Compare the fingerprint against the database
- Return the best match along with a confidence score

## 🔍 How It Works

<details>
<summary>Audio Fingerprinting Process</summary>

Saudentify uses a spectral analysis approach for audio fingerprinting:

1. Audio is converted to a spectrogram representation
2. Key points ("landmarks") are extracted from the spectrogram
3. Fingerprints are generated by pairing landmarks
4. These fingerprints are stored in an SQLite database
5. Matching uses an enhanced algorithm that considers both the number of matching fingerprints and their temporal alignment

</details>

<details>
<summary>File Format Support</summary>

- **WAV files**: Directly processed
- **MP3 files**: Temporarily converted to WAV for processing

</details>

## 🔧 Code Example

```java
// Example of identifying a song from a file
EnhancedMatcher.MatchResult result = fingerprinter.identifyFile("path/to/song.mp3");
System.out.println("\nResult: " + result);
```

## 📊 Performance

| Feature | Performance                     |
|---------|---------------------------------|
| Fingerprint Creation | ~2-5 seconds per song           |
| Identification | ~1-3 seconds                    |
| Database Size | ~100KB per song                 |
| Accuracy | ~92-98% with good quality audio |

## 🔮 Future Improvements

- [ ] Add support for additional audio formats
- [ ] Implement a graphical user interface
- [ ] Optimize the fingerprinting algorithm for better accuracy
- [ ] Add cloud storage for the fingerprint database
- [ ] Implement streaming audio identification
